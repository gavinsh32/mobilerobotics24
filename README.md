# mobilerobotics24

A controller designed for a quadcopter built as part of Vandal Robotics Club.

This project ended unfinished. Client.py is a python client which accepts a connection from Server.py, which establishes
singly-linked ad-hoc connection with the client, enabling wireless control. This was done because WiFi has a range of 
~30m, which is much farther than the connection supported by bluetooth.
